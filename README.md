# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot
Assignment for an Artificial Intelligence course. Comprises of 3 bots:
- A simple bot that plays random moves every single time.
- A slightly more complicated bot that checks if there is a winning move and plays it; otherwise, it plays as random move.
- An even more complicated bot that check if there is a winning move, then checks if the other player has a winning move (and blocks it if it does), or plays a random move if the other two conditions are not satisfied.

The interface for the game has been created using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).
